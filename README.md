# Parallel-Plate-Capacitive-MEMS-Mirror-for-Interferometer
Details and specifications of our design for a parallel plate MEMS capacitor which will be used to control a movable mirror in an interferometer device. 

We made experimental calculations to optimize a system reaching a maximum steady displacement with minimum input voltage. Our report includes design specifications, sketches and simulation results obtained from MATLAB and CAD tool of such a device.
